# OBS Chatbot Frontend

This Create-React-App application provides the frontend for the OBS Chatbot [backend services](https://github.com/TinaTiel/obs-chatbot-services). 

## Running Locally

Currently the backend is mocked via [Open API definitions](https://github.com/TinaTiel/obs-chatbot-openapi). You can start those services first, and then start the frontend as you would a react app: 

```
npm start
```
